# Home Assisant Import

Hi, welcome to my attempt at importing data into Home Assistant. The Goal is to import data from

- Domoticz with P1/DMSR data (Version: 2020.2 (build 12497) Build Hash: c8f1e167e-modified)
- SMA Inverter with Solar production data (version unknown)

At this point the import tool is not usable for usage, unless you are a developer completing the code yourself ;)
